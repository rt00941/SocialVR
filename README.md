# SocialVR
For the following course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-3d-characters-social-virtual-reality?specialization=virtual-reality

My scene has a guide in a forest who will welcome you there. To use the scene you should have an android phone with API 19 or higher that can run cardboard. Also the latest LTS version of Unity, 2019.4.3f1 has been used to make this application so that should be used to run it. Once you open the project, open 'MyScene' from Assets>Scenes, add it in build settings and build and run it for android with your phone connected to the computer. You can also use the forestconversation.apk to run it directly on your phone by copying the file to your phone and installing and running it. If you want to run it on something else besides cardboard you can change the settings in the player. Once the scene opens on your device you should gaze at the guide or talk to her. When you do she will come closer and talk to you. To answer her question you can either nod or shake your head. The microphone works better if you are able to test in the unity player.
